 - Test if audiocontext can be created automatically, and if so, restore autostart state
 - Retry stream after failure / fix autostart functionality after failure
 - Volume is not restored correctly when starting a stream. Probably because I still don't understand how to use functional component props properly inside `useCallback`.
